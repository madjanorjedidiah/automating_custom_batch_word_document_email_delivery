### automating_custom_batch_word_document_email_delivery

- the purpose of this project is to help automate the customization od word documents (letters)
- and delivering them to their respective emails.


##### This is a python project. Just doing this for fun.

##### How it Works
- It works by having 2 files. 1 word document and 1 csv. 
- The csv holds the user information and email details which will be used to replace the placeholders in the document.
- The word document contains the sample letter or text with placeholders indecating what needs to be changed in the word document.

- We first readd from the csv and then go on ahead to make edits in the word document. there are someplaces that needs to be changed for use case to work.
